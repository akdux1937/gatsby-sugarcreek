The goal of regenerative farming is to regenerate the soil and the biology within the soil. We practice regenerative farming through rotational grazing of the cattle. By moving the herd to a new paddock daily, we allow the previous day's paddock regrow and regenerate. By running the herd through the paddocks, we stress and stimulate the grasses. In turn, this stresses and stimulates the soil and the micro-organisms in the soil. Stress is good. It activates the plants, and they grow more hearty. As the plant regrows it sequesters much more carbon. The extra carbon gets exchanged for nutrients from micro-organisms and mycorrhizal fungi. Over time this approach minimizes the loss of topsoil. Retains more carbon. Increases biodiversity like bacteria, fungi, and worms, and maintains nutrient and water cycles.

As a rotational grazed herd moves from paddock to paddock it consumes about 40% of the grasses. The rest gets trampled creating a layer of mulch/compost. This compost is a source of food for the micro-organisms in the soil. It also covers the soil, aides in water retention and helps prevent erosion.

Whatever your convictions. Whether it is mother nature or the hand of God. There is a beautiful plan in place if we work with it instead of thinking that we need to improve it or fix it. To be sustainable is not good enough, if you are not working as nature intended than you are not sustainable.

Regenerative Farming is Sustainable.
