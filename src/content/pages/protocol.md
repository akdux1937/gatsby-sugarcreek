### Grass-Fed (No Grain)

100% of the diet of our grassfed animals consists of freshly grazed pasture and stored grasses (hay or grass silage.) Free-choice minerals supplentations may also be given as needed. 

### No Hormones or Steroids

Hormones or steroids are never administered to animals. (The FDA does not allow the use hormones or antibotics in the production of pork or poutlry.)

### Never Fed Drugs Or Antibiotics*

\* Our natural production practices eliminates the need for sub therapeutic (daily fed low level dose) medications that are commonly used in confinement production systems. However, in certain cases to prevent animals from death or suffering we do allow for limited use of therapeutic (spot treatment) medication. In such cases the prescribed withdrawal period is doubled before animals are ever harvested. We feel that this exception is only practical to ensure wise stewardship practices and ethical treatment of our livestock.

### GMO-Free

Animals raised without feeding genetically modified organisms such as GMO corn or soybeans. 

### Pasture-Raised

As the seasons allow annimals are raised in the open pasture or field.

### Winter Housed

To raise our high quality meat, Sugar Creek Farms' animals are seasonally accommodated during winter. 

### No Animal By-Products

Raised without feeding any animal by-products.

### Supplemented with Non-GMO Grains

Animals provided with free-choice non-GMO whole grains such as oats, barley, corn or soybeans.
