At Sugar Creek Farms we take our responsibility as stewards of the earth seriously and use regenerate farming techniques to improve the land. All our beef is 100% grass-fed and finished, pasture raised and rotated daily to fresh pasture. The herd is non-GMO, antibiotic free and always humanely raised and harvested.
