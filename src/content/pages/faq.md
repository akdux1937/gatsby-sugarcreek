### What is a pickup location?

(NOTE: Pickups are currently closed due to COVID-19) Pickup Locations are simply places where we meet you with your order. Common locations are home driveways or parking lots. Each location is organized by a volunteer Location Leader who helps to facilitate each delivery.

### How much freezer space will I need?

As a general rule of thumb, one cubic foot of freezer space will hold up to 25 pounds of meat.

### Do you offer raw milk?

We currently do not offer any dairy products.

### Are products freshly frozen?

Unlike a common industry practice, our product does not spend time fresh on a sales shelf and then frozen as a last resort to extend its life. Rather, all of our meat products are flash frozen immediately after processing to preserve freshness!
